## 🚀 About the Project

This is my personal developer portfolio designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. It features a modern neon/cyberpunk aesthetic with dynamic 3D elements, smooth scroll animations, and a fully functional contact form.

### ✨ Features
- **3D Interactive Elements**: Built using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` (checkout the interactive "Under Construction" page!).
- **Sleek Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for smooth page transitions and scroll reveals.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Designed with `Tailwind CSS` featuring a dark mode neon aesthetic with a custom cursor and scroll progress indicator.
- **Functional Contact Form**: Integrated with `EmailJS` to receive messages directly to my inbox.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
